Generate a comprehensive session handoff summary that I can paste into a new chat to continue where we left off.

Review our entire conversation and create a structured handoff document with:

## 1. Project Context
- What project/codebase we're working in
- The working directory path
- Any relevant branch or git state

## 2. Session Goal
- What was the main task or goal we were working on
- Why we were doing it (the user's original request)

## 3. Work Completed
- List what was accomplished in this session
- Files that were created or modified (with brief descriptions)
- Any commands that were run or configurations changed

## 4. Current State
- Where exactly we stopped
- Any errors or issues we were dealing with
- The state of any in-progress work

## 5. Next Steps
- What needs to be done next to continue
- Any pending tasks or items we discussed but didn't complete
- Decisions that still need to be made

## 6. Key Context
- Important technical details the next session needs to know
- Any constraints, patterns, or approaches we decided on
- Relevant file paths or code locations

---

Format the output as a clean, copy-pasteable prompt that starts with:

```
## Continue Session: [Brief Title]

I'm continuing work from a previous session. Here's the context:

[... the summary ...]

Please review this context and help me continue with [next step].
```

Make it concise but complete - include everything needed to resume without losing context.
